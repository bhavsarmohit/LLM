1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Description: Updates weights based on a single (or mini-batch) data sample.

Strengths:
Simple and computationally efficient.
Works well for large datasets and convex problems.

Limitations:
Converges slowly.
Struggles with learning rates and can get stuck in local minima.

When to Use:
Classical machine learning tasks or when resources are limited.

2. Momentum

Description: Adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update to smooth out gradients.

Strengths:
Speeds up convergence.
Handles oscillations in the optimization path.

When to Use:
When SGD converges too slowly or oscillates.

3. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

Description: Combines ideas from RMSProp and Momentum by adapting learning rates for each parameter and using running averages of gradients.

Strengths:
Works well for most problems.
Efficient and requires less parameter tuning.
Handles sparse gradients well.

Limitations:
Can sometimes converge to suboptimal solutions.

When to Use:
Most deep learning tasks, including NLP, computer vision, and time-series modeling.

4. RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)

Description: Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on recent gradient magnitudes.

Strengths:
Performs well for non-stationary objectives (e.g., RNNs).
Balances learning rate effectively.

When to Use:
Recurrent Neural Networks or tasks where gradients vary significantly.

5. AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)

Description: Adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on past gradients.

Strengths:
Excellent for sparse data or features (e.g., NLP tasks).

Limitations:
Learning rate decays too quickly for longer training sessions.

When to Use:
Problems with sparse gradients like recommendation systems.

6. AdamW (Adam with Weight Decay)

Description: A variation of Adam that adds decoupled weight decay for better generalization.

Strengths:
Prevents overfitting by controlling weight magnitudes.
Recommended for transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT.

When to Use:
Modern deep learning models where generalization matters.

7. Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

Description: A variant of Momentum that looks ahead before updating gradients.

Strengths:
Provides more accurate gradient updates.
Speeds up convergence in some cases.

When to Use:
Problems where momentum struggles to optimize effectively.
